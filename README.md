### About Me

Above all, I am a tenacious problem-solver. [Truck stop waitress -> Princeton PhD.] With 10+ years of data science experience [AI, ML, NLP] I now support the health and wellbeing of 2+ million TimelyCare members. Although I enjoy data, my true passion is teaching. Mentees and colleagues commend my ability to blend technical precision with empathetic communication. Families literally let me shoot lasers into their babies’ brains – for science! – because I excel at clearly explaining complex ideas.

Highlights from my skillset include:
- Programming: SQL, Python [pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, statsforecast, nltk, spacy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotnine], R, Git, Bitbucket, AWS, Snowflake, Jira, Confluence

- Machine Learning: feature engineering, dimensionality reduction [PCA], K-means clustering, regression, classification [KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost], neural networks [CNN, RNN]

- Natural Language Processing [NLP]: speech-to-text, tokenization, embeddings, named entity recognition [NER], sentiment analysis, topic modeling, HuggingFace

Need an ice-breaker? Try asking me:
- Why should I use positive reinforcement to shape team performance?
- When should I use KNN instead of mean imputation?
- How can I teach psychopharmacology via dodgeball?
