### I'm a Data Scientist with expertise in healthcare, natural language processing, and machine learning. 

Currently I'm seeking a project-focused team where I can leverage my skills to support customers’ health and wellbeing.

### Why should you hire me?
I'm curious, creative, and driven. (I started off as a truck stop waitress. Now I have a PhD from Princeton.) Throughout my career, I have quickly and independently learned new tools and methods because I love intellectual challenges. Furthermore, I excel in building empathetic relationships with stakeholders. My colleagues describe me as conscientious, genuine, and compassionate.

### Highlights from my skillset include:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** speech to text, sentiment analysis, document clustering (topic modeling)
- **Machine Learning (ML):** feature selection, dimensionality reduction (PCA), model selection (regression, classification, clustering), hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation (cross-validation, AIC/BIC)
- **Programming:** SQL, R, Python, Git
- **Data Preparation:** tidyverse, dplyr, stringr, numpy, pandas, reticulate
- **Data Visualization:** R markdown, ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Communication:** Families literally let me shoot lasers into their babies’ brains – for science! – because I excel at explaining complex ideas in clear terms.
