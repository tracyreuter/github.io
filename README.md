### About Me

Above all, I am a tenacious problem-solver. [Truck stop waitress -> Princeton PhD.] I have 10+ years of experience building data science solutions [AI, ML, NLP]. Currently I lead end-to-end projects [demand forecasting, capacity planning, customer segmentation, etc.] to support the health and wellbeing of 2+ million members. Although I enjoy working with data, my true passion is teaching. Mentees and colleagues commend my ability to blend technical precision with empathetic communication. Families literally let me shoot lasers into their babies’ brains – for science! – because I excel at clearly explaining complex ideas.

Highlights from my skillset include:
- Programming: SQL, Python [pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, statsforecast, nltk, spacy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotnine], R, Git, Bitbucket, AWS, Snowflake, Jira, Confluence

- Machine Learning: feature engineering, dimensionality reduction [PCA], K-means clustering, regression, classification [KNN, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost], neural networks [CNN, RNN]

- Natural Language Processing [NLP]: speech-to-text, tokenization, embeddings, named entity recognition [NER], sentiment analysis, topic modeling, HuggingFace

Need an ice-breaker? Try asking me:
- Why should I use positive reinforcement to shape team performance?
- When should I use KNN instead of mean imputation?
- How can I teach psychopharmacology via dodgeball?
