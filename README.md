### Data Science leader with expertise in healthcare, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Above all, I’m a tenacious problem-solver. (I went from truck stop waitress to Princeton PhD.) As a leader, I coach my direct reports beyond their comfort zone to achieve their unique goals. Mentees summarize my style as engaging, responsive, and “the perfect balance of instruction and independence.” Similarly, my colleagues describe me as collaborative, kind, and “the ultimate team player” because I blend technical precision with empathetic communication. Families literally let me shoot lasers into their babies’ brains – for science! – because I excel at explaining complex ideas in clear terms.
