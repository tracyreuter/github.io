### Data Scientist with 12+ years' experience [AI, ML, NLP].

Above all, I am a tenacious problem-solver. [Truck stop waitress -> Princeton PhD.] Mentees summarize my style as “the perfect balance of instruction and independence" and colleagues commend my ability to blend technical precision with empathetic communication. Families literally let me shoot lasers into their babies’ brains – for science! – because I excel at clearly explaining complex ideas.
