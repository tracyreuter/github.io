### I'm a Data Scientist with 10+ years' experience in behavioral science, healthcare, and psycholinguistics. 

Currently I'm seeking a project-focused team where I can leverage my skills in research design, predictive modeling, programming, and data visualization to support customers' health and wellbeing.

### Why should you hire me?

I'm curious, creative, and driven. (I started off as a truck stop waitress. Now I have a PhD from Princeton.) Throughout my career, I have quickly and independently learned new tools and methods because I love intellectual challenges. Furthermore, I excel in building empathetic relationships with stakeholders. My colleagues describe me as conscientious, genuine, and compassionate.
